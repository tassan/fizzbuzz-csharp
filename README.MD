# fizzbuzz in csharp

## Rules of Fizzbuzz

- If a number is multiple of 3 return: "fizz"
- If a number is multiple of 5 return: "buzz"
- If a number is multiple of 3 and 5 return: "fizzbuzz"
- For any other number just return the number itself

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Build the project
3. Run the tests
4. Run the console app (optional)

```console

git clone https://github.com/tassan/fizzbuzz-csharp.git
cd fizzbuzz-csharp
dotnet build
dotnet test

```

Assuming you already has an csharp development environment.

If for any reason you prefer using the Visual Studio, just open the *fizzbuzz.sln*.
and build and test from there.
